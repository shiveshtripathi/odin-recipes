    <h1>Spicy Grilled Stuffed Chicken Breast Sandwich</h1>
    <p>
      Chicken breast stuffed with slices of avocado, jalapeno pepper, and
      Monterey Jack cheese, served on a bun with toppings of your choice. I like
      mayo and tomato.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>8 thin slices Monterey Jack cheese</li>
      <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and sliced</li>
      <li>1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and sliced</li>
      <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>½ lime, juiced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon spicy mesquite-flavored seasoning</li>
      <li>1 pinch sea salt</li>
      <li>1 cup chipotle barbeque sauce</li>
      <li>4 Kaiser rolls, split</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
      Slice a small pocket into each chicken breast with a sharp knife. Layer
      cheese slices, avocado slices, and sliced jalapeno inside the chicken
      pockets. Pinch chicken breasts closed and secure with toothpicks or
      skewers; place chicken into a casserole dish.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
      Whisk olive oil, lime juice, mesquite seasoning, and salt together in a
      bowl; drizzle half of the mixture over chicken breasts. Turn chicken
      breasts over and drizzle with remaining olive oil mixture; cover and
      refrigerate for 30 minutes.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
      Place chicken breasts on preheated grill and cook for 7 minutes; turn
      chicken over and brush with BBQ sauce on the cooked side. Continue
      grilling for about 5 minutes; turn chicken over and apply BBQ sauce to the
      second cooked side. Cook chicken until no longer pink in the center and
      the juices run clear, about 2 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer
      inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees
      C).
    </p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Serve each chicken breast on a Kaiser roll.</p>
