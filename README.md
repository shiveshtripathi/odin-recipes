# odin-recipes

This is [Odin Recipe Learning Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) which can be found at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

Learned to write simple HTML tags and pre plan the parts of the project. I still had to improve the webpages despite planning before starting. New features to add to it came to mind from seeing other websites.

Learning is hard there is no doubt. Respect to all the developers for catapulting this digital age forward with the effort despite so much disturbance around. Thank You.
